This application takes in either a P3 or P6 formatted image and outputs the
image data to a file as a P3 or P6 image, depending on what the user selects.

This program is capable of converting:
        P3 -> P6
        P3 -> P3
        P6 -> P3
        P6 -> P6

Usage:
  ppmrw format inputfile.ppm outputfile.ppm

Where "format" is the desired format for the output image data (3 or 6).
